# Milwaukee Trivia game

This multiple-choice timed game was created using html form elements and javascript setInterval and timeOut functions to load each question. If else statements evaluate the user's answer and update the DOM accordingly.

## Rules
Press start to start the game.

Questions will load automatically. You have 20 seconds to answer each question.

After you answer the game will notify you if you were right or wrong, and will display the correct answer if you got it wrong. 
The correct answer will also display if you ran out of time before answering.

The next question will load automatically after the previous question's right/wrong message and the timer restarts.

At the end of all questions you will be given your game stats of total correct answers, incorrect answers, and skipped questions.
